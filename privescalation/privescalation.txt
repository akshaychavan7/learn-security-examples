• Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.
- In insecure.js, when a user hits the /update-role endpoint, we do not have any authetication mechanism to verify the user's identity. So, adding a strong authetication would make it secure.
• What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such
attacks?
- We can add a strong authetication mechanism like 2FA.
